# python-inference
This Python program implements a basic type inference engine using the Hindley-Milner algorithm to analyze simple Python code. It parses code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and infers types for constructs like lambda expressions, single-parameter functions, function calls, variable assignments, and dictionary access. The `Inferencer` class handles the type logic through unification and substitution, while the `test_code()` function processes and prints inferred types for each test case. The `__main__` section runs several examples, demonstrating inference on identity functions, arithmetic, lambdas, and dictionary lookups, with optional hints to guide the process.
